htsim version 0.1
------------------

Opertaing System
----------------
was tested on linux and free bsd/mac osx.

To install: uncompress and
- run make in sim directory
- run make in the sim/datacentre

1. To run tests with htsim in simple topologies just 
invoke the executable sim/htsim. The topology is created in the main file
By default it will output data to ../data/logout.dat. 

To analyze logs: install R first (http://cran.r-project.org/).
In R, set the working directory to analysis and load analysis.R
This will parse the data/logout.dat file. See docs on how to plot
various data.

2. To run datacentre simulations go to sim/datacentre. The main file
includes the topology (fattree or star - this is basically a switch) and 
the connection matrix. Run make and then call htsim_dc with the following params:
htsim_dc -o NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE - name of the logfile that will have the experiment results 
	 [-sub SUBFLOW_COUNT]  - how many subflows should we use per connection?
	 [-param PARAMS_FOR_CONNECTION_MATRIX] connection matrix dependent, e.g. how many connections per host
	 [CONGESTION_CONTROL_ALGORITHM] regular TCP for each subflow or MPTCP? Defaults to MPTCP.
